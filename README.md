# Wizards
Repository for creating a "Wizards" 2-D game using [Slick2D](https://github.com/exovum/slickwizards/blob/master/README.md#resources "Resources") , a 2-D game library for the Java programming language.

### Summary
Specifics to be determined.

The general idea is that the player will delve into several tombs of some ancient wizards looking for treasure. The tombs for each wizard reflect their powers, such as fire traps for the fire wizard and ice traps for the ice wizard's tomb. The player is meant to raid each tomb and solve the puzzles within to find various treasures and items. A few of the hidden items should add benefits to the player, including assistance to find more secrets or to beat the current wizard's traps. Combat by the player is meant to be _limited_. This means the goal is to make the player focus on dodging rather than fighting back (though perhaps combat could be a feature for later). 

### Goals and Guidelines
1. **Keep it Simple**
2. Limited (if any) combat
3. _To be determined_

### Approximate Timeline

1. Movement and Map Collisions
2. Map Creation
3. Trap Collisions
4. _To be determined_

### Resources
The "Wizards" game will be using the Slick2D java game library. It is a library based on lwjgl (light-weight java game library).
